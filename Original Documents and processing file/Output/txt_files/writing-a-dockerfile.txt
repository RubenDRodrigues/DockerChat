description: This concept page will teach you how to create image using Dockerfile.
summary: |
  Mastering Dockerfile practices is vital for leveraging container technology
  effectively, enhancing application reliability and supporting DevOps and
  CI/CD methodologies. In this guide, you’ll learn how to write a Dockerfile,
  how to define a base image and setup instructions, including software
  installation and copying necessary files.

Explanation


A Dockerfile is a text-based document that's used to create a container image. It provides instructions to the image builder on the commands to run, files to copy, startup command, and more.


As an example, the following Dockerfile would produce a ready-to-run Python application:


```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12
WORKDIR /usr/local/app


Install the application dependencies


COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt


Copy in the source code


COPY src ./src
EXPOSE 5000


Setup an app user so the container doesn't run as the root user


RUN useradd app
USER app


CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]
```


Common instructions


Some of the most common instructions in a 
Dockerfile
 include:




FROM <image>
 - this specifies the base image that the build will extend.


WORKDIR <path>
 - this instruction specifies the "working directory" or the path in the image where files will be copied and commands will be executed.


COPY <host-path> <image-path>
 - this instruction tells the builder to copy files from the host and put them into the container image.


RUN <command>
 - this instruction tells the builder to run the specified command.


ENV <name> <value>
 - this instruction sets an environment variable that a running container will use.


EXPOSE <port-number>
 - this instruction sets configuration on the image that indicates a port the image would like to expose.


USER <user-or-uid>
 - this instruction sets the default user for all subsequent instructions.


CMD ["<command>", "<arg1>"]
 - this instruction sets the default command a container using this image will run.

Try it out


Just as you saw with the previous example, a Dockerfile typically follows these steps:




Determine your base image


Install application dependencies


Copy in any relevant source code and/or binaries


Configure the final image




In this quick hands-on guide, you'll write a Dockerfile that builds a simple Node.js application. If you're not familiar with JavaScript-based applications, don't worry. It isn't necessary for following along with this guide.


Set up


Download this ZIP file
 and extract the contents into a directory on your machine.


Creating the Dockerfile


Now that you have the project, you’re ready to create the 
Dockerfile
.






Download and install
 Docker Desktop.






Create a file named 
Dockerfile
 in the same folder as the file 
package.json
.




Dockerfile file extensions


It's important to note that the 
Dockerfile
 has 
no
 file extension. Some editors
will automatically add an extension to the file (or complain it doesn't have one).








In the 
Dockerfile
, define your base image by adding the following line:


dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine






Now, define the working directory by using the 
WORKDIR
 instruction. This will specify where future commands will run and the directory files will be copied inside the container image.


dockerfile
WORKDIR /app






Copy all of the files from your project on your machine into the container image by using the 
COPY
 instruction:


dockerfile
COPY . .






Install the app's dependencies by using the 
yarn
 CLI and package manager. To do so, run a command using the 
RUN
 instruction:


dockerfile
RUN yarn install --production






Finally, specify the default command to run by using the 
CMD
 instruction:


dockerfile
CMD ["node", "./src/index.js"]

And with that, you should have the following Dockerfile:


dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN yarn install --production
CMD ["node", "./src/index.js"]








This Dockerfile isn't production-ready yet


It's important to note that this Dockerfile is 
not
 following all
of the best practices yet (by design). It will build the app, but the
builds won't be as fast, or the images as secure, as they could be.


Keep reading to learn more about how to make the image maximize the
build cache, run as a non-root user, and multi-stage builds.


Containerize new projects quickly with 
docker init


The 
docker init
 command will analyze your project and quickly create 
a Dockerfile, a 
compose.yaml
, and a 
.dockerignore
, helping you get
up and going. Since you're learning about Dockerfiles specifically here, 
you won't use it now. But, 
learn more about it here

Next steps


Now that you have created a Dockerfile and learned the basics, it's time to learn about building, tagging, and pushing the images.
